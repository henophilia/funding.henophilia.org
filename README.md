# Hermes' Loom

Our vision is to index every non-profit funding opportunity, organization and tender in the world, to democratize and stimulate philanthropic synergies and to drive forward regenerative societal transformation from the hyperlocal to the global level. Free and open source from the very beginning, continuing the movement of realizing the delightfully humanist potential of AI and LLMs.

## The name

In Greek mythology, **Hermes** is the god of communication, travel, trade, and boundaries. He is often seen as a messenger who bridges different realms and delivers crucial information. Associating this platform with Hermes suggests that it will serve as a messenger of information, delivering funding opportunities and connecting organizations globally.

A **loom** is a device used to weave fabric, which symbolizes the act of connecting threads into a unified whole. It suggests that this platform will weave together the disparate threads of nonprofit funding opportunities and philanthropic initiatives across the globe, creating a unified, interconnected network.

Together, "Hermes' Loom" reflects our mission to weave a network of funding possibilities, enabling societal transformation through the power of open-source AI and holistic collaboration.
